# HGLL

Haskell GLL (HGLL) is an effort towards a certifiable GLL parsing framework
written in Haskell.

As of now, HGLL does not have a general parser algorithm implemented. Details
of why can be found in the .pdf document available in the repository root. The
document corresponds to my master's thesis on the subject of certifiable,
general parsing, in a purely functional setup.
